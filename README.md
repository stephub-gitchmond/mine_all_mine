# Mine, all mine!

## Background
You run a mining village. You populate your village with *characters*:
- **Miners** (spades) dig for diamonds.
- **Thugs** (clubs) guard your miners, or kidnap rivals.
- **Lovers** (hearts) pair up with Miners or Thugs to increase their strength.

Each character card has a *strength* given by it's face value. Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) have strength of 10, and Aces have a strength of 11.

The winner is the first player to mine the Ace of Diamonds!

## To Start
1. Place all diamonds in the centre, face-up. This is the *mine*.
2. Deal 2 cards to each player.

## On your turn
1. Take a card from the deck and add it to your hand.
2. Play a card from your hand onto the table in front of you, face-up. That is your *village*.
2. Perform an action from the list below.

## Available actions
Perform actions using the cards in your *village* (i.e. face-up in front of you), unless otherwise noted.

1. **Play another card:** Play a card from your hand to your village.
2. **Mine:** Take a diamond from the centre and add it to your village.
  - The diamond's value cannot be higher than the total strength of your Miners.
  - The *Ace of Diamonds* is special, and requires a total of 25 to mine.
3. **Bribe:** Pay one or more diamonds to attract a character from a rival village.
  - The diamonds must be of equal or higher value than the target.
  - The target cannot be part of a couple.
  - The target is added to your hand.
  - The diamond goes back in the mine.
4. **Kidnap:** Your Thugs kidnap another character!
  - Announce the target character, then indicate which of your thugs are participating. Their total strength must be greater than the strength of the defending thugs.
  - Add the target character to your hand.
  - The attacking Thugs cannot attack or defend until the end of your next turn. Indicate this by turning the cards sideways.
5. **Seduce:** Your Lover seduces a rival character, keeping them "busy" for a turn.
  - The target must be a Miner or Thug.
  - The Lover cannot be part of a pair.
  - You *can* seduce a character that's paired with a Lover, but the attacking Lover must be stronger than the defending Lover.
  - The target cannot be used until the end of its owner's next turn. Indicate this by turning the card sideways.
  - The defending Lover is returned to the owner's hand.

## Lovers
At any point during your turn, you can pair a Lover with a Miner or Thug.
- Both characters must be in your village.
- Neither character can be part of a couple already.
- A character paired with a Lover gains +1 to its strength.

A pair cannot be split up, except if one member is kidnapped or seduced.
