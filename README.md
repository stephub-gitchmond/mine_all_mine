# Mine, all mine!

## Background
You run a mining village. In your village are:
- *Miners*, represented by *spades*
- *Thugs*, represented by *clubs*
- *Lovers*, represented by *hearts*

Miners dig up diamonds, Thugs provide security, and Lovers pair up with Thugs or Miners to make them stronger.

Each character card has a *strength* given by it's face value. Face cards have strength of 10, and Aces have a strength of 11.

The winner is the first player to mine the Ace of Diamonds!

## Lovers
Lovers are special cards that can be paired with Miners and Thugs. When paired, they increase the strength of their partner by 1.

Once paired, a lover can't be unpaired. However, if a character leaves their village, their partner _does not_ come with them.

## To Start
Place all *diamonds* in the centre of the table, face-up.

Deal 1 card to each player.

## On your turn
1. Take a card from the deck and add it to your hand.
2. If you have any unpaired lovers in your village, you may pair them with a Thug or Miner.
2. Perform one action from the list below.

## Available actions
Perform actions using the cards in your *village* (i.e. face-up in front of you), unless otherwise noted.

1. **Do nothing:** you may choose to do nothing, or be unable to.
2. **Stock your village:** Move any number of cards from your hand to your village.
2. **Mine:** Take a diamond from the centre and add it to your hand. The diamond must be of *lower* value than the total value of all Miners in your village.
3. **Bribe:** Attempt to bribe a single character (Miner, Thug, or Lover) to come to your side. This is a bidding war between you and the current owner.
  - You cannot bid more than the total value of the diamonds you have.
  - The winner adds that character to their village, and discards diamonds from their hand equal to (or greater than) their bid.
  - The loser keeps their diamonds.
  - The discarded diamonds go back to the centre, face up.
  - If the character is attached to a Lover, the value of the Lover counts towards the current owner's bid, but the Lover is *not* discarded.
4. **Kidnap:** Your Thugs attempt to kidnap another character! Whoever can deploy the strongest gang of Thugs wins.
  - Announce which Thug is attempting the kidnap, and who the target is (Miner, Thug, or Lover). Push them forward so it's obvious.
  - The targeted player can then send Thugs to defend, if they wish. Push these forward so it's obvious.
  - This keeps going until a player gives up or runs out of Thugs.
  - The winner is the player with the highest total value. The value of the target counts towards the defender's total. On a draw, the defender wins.
  - If they attacker is successful, the targeted character joins their village.
  - _All_ characters involved (including the target) are unusable until the end of their owner's next turn. Turn the cards sideways to indicate this.
