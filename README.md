# Mine, all mine!

## Background
You run a mining village. You populate your village with *characters*:
- **Miners** (spades) dig for diamonds.
- **Thugs** (clubs) guard your miners, or kidnap rivals.
- **Lovers** (hearts) pair up with Miners or Thugs to increase their strength.

Each character card has a *strength* given by it's face value. Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) have strength of 10, and Aces have a strength of 11.

The winner is the first player to mine the Ace of Diamonds!

## To Start
1. Place all diamonds in the centre, face-up. This is the *mine*.
2. Deal 2 cards to each player.

## On your turn
1. Take a card from the deck and add it to your hand.
2. Play a card from your hand onto the table in front of you, face-up. That is your *village*.
2. Perform an action from the list below.

## Available actions
Perform actions using the cards in your *village* (i.e. face-up in front of you), unless otherwise noted.

1. **Play another card:** Play a card from your hand to your village.
2. **Mine:** Take a diamond from the centre and add it to your village.
 - The diamond's value cannot be higher than the total strength of your Miners.
 - The *Ace of Diamonds* is special, and requires a total of 25 to mine.
3. **Bribe:** Pay one or more diamonds to attract a character from a rival village.
  - The diamonds must be of equal or higher value than the target.
  - The target cannot be part of a couple.
  - The target is added to your hand.
  - The diamond goes back in the mine.
4. **Kidnap:** Your Thugs kidnap another character!
  1. Announce the target character.
  2. Indicate which of your thugs are participating. Their total strength must be greater than the total strength of the defending thugs.
  3. Add the target character to your hand.
  4. The attacking Thugs cannot attack or defend until the end of your next turn. Turn them sideways to indicate this.

## Lovers
At any point during your turn, you can pair a Lover with a Miner or Thug.
- both characters must be in your village
- neither character can be part of a couple already

A pair cannot be split up, except if one member is kidnapped.
