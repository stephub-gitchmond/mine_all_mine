# Mine, all mine!

## Background
You run a mining village. You populate your village with character cards:
- **Miners** (spades) dig for diamonds.
- **Thugs** (clubs) guard your miners, or kidnap rivals.
- **Lovers** (hearts) pair up with Miners or Thugs to increase their strength.

Each character card has a *strength* given by it's face value. Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) have strength of 10, and Aces have a strength of 11.

The winner is the first player to mine the Ace of Diamonds!

### Lovers
Lovers are special cards that can be paired with Miners and Thugs. They increase the strength of their partner by 1.

## To Start
1. Place all *diamonds* in the centre of the table, face-up. This is the *mine*.
2. Deal 2 cards to each player.

## On your turn
1. Take a card from the deck and add it to your hand.
2. Perform up to 3 actions from the list below.

At any point during your turn, you can pair a Lover with a Miner or Thug, provided both are currently in your village and unpaired.

## Available actions
Perform actions using the cards in your *village* (i.e. face-up in front of you), unless otherwise noted.

1. **Populate your village:** Move 1 card from your hand to your village.
2. **Mine:** Take a diamond from the centre and add it to your hand. The diamond must not be of higher value than the total value of all Miners in your village.  
The *Ace of Diamonds* is special, and requires a total of 25 to mine.
3. **Bribe:** Attempt to bribe a single character (Miner, Thug, or Lover) to come to your side. This is a bidding war between you and the current owner.
  - You cannot bid more than the total value of the diamonds you have.
  - If the character is attached to a Lover, the value of the Lover counts towards the current owner's bid, but the Lover is *not* discarded.
  - The winner discards diamonds equal to their bid, the loser keeps theirs.
  - The discarded diamonds go back to the mine (middle of the table).
  - If the character was successfully lured to a new player, they join that player's hand.
4. **Kidnap:** Your Thugs attempt to kidnap another character! Whoever can deploy the strongest gang of Thugs wins.
  - Announce which Thug is attempting the kidnap, and who the target is (Miner, Thug, or Lover). Push the Thug forward so it's obvious.
  - The targeted player can then send Thugs to defend, if they wish. Push these forward so it's obvious.
  - This keeps going until a player gives up or runs out of Thugs.
  - The winner is the player with the highest total strength. The value of the *target* counts towards the defender's total. On a draw, the defender wins.
  - If the attacker is successful, they add the targeted character to their hand.
  - _All_ Thugs involved are unusable until the *end* of their owner's next turn. Turn the cards sideways to indicate this.
